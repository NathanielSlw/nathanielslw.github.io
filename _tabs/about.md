Hello, I’m **Nathaniel**, a 4th-year engineering student specializing in Cybersecurity. My passion for cybersecurity drives me to constantly improve my skills through Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, research, and real-world challenges. I focus primarily on **offensive security**, where I enjoy identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities.

On this site, I share my **CTF writeups**, which serve as a way for me to **document my learning journey**, analyze new techniques, and improve my problem-solving skills. I also share insights on the **tools** I develop and other **cybersecurity topics** that I explore in my free time.

Hope you find my writeups and content useful or inspiring for your own learning journey!
